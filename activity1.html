</b></font>
<p>By Clare Duffy, CNN Business</p>
<p>Updated 5:21 AM EST, Tue November 29, 2022</p>
<p><b>New York CNN Business</b> - Elon Musk on Monday claimed that Apple has "threatened" to pull Twitter from its iOS app store, a move that could be devastating to the company Mark just acquired for $44 billion.</p>
<p><i>"Apple (<u>AAPL</u>) has also threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store, but won't tell us why",</i>Musk said in one of several tweets Monday taking aim at Apple (<u>AAPL</u>) and its CEO for alleged moves that could undermine Twitter's business.</p>
<p>In another tweet, Musk claimed that Apple has mostly stopped advertising on Twitter. <i>"Do they hate free speech in America,"</i>he said, in an apparent reference to his oft-stated desire to bolster his idea of free speech on the platform. <i>"What's going on here [Apple CEO Tim Cook]?"</i>Musk added in a follow-up tweet. He also <u>criticized</u> Apple's size, <u>claimed</u> it engages in "censorship", and <u>called out</u> the 30% transaction fee Apple charges large app developers to be listed in its app store..</p>
<p>In one tweet Monday, Musk asked his nearly 120 million followers if they know <i>"Apple puts a secret 30% tax on everything you buy through their App store?"</i>In another tweet, he posted a picture of a highway exit: one lane headed toward "<i>pay 30%,</i>" the other pointed toward "go to war." An old car labeled "Elon" skidded toward the latter.</p>
