<font face="Verdana">Once upon a time there was <font face="Verdana" color="violet"><b>an old man, an old woman, </b></font>and</font></br>
<font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" color="violet"><b>a little boy.</b></font> <font face="Verdana" color="green"><u>One morning,</u></font> the old woman made some</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">gingerbread in the shape of a man. She added icing for his</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">hair and clothes, and little blobs of dough for his nose and</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">eyes. When she put him in the oven to bake, she said to the</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">little boy, "You watch the gingerbread man while your</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">grandfather and I go out to work in the garden."</font></br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana">So the old man and the old woman went out and began to</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">dig potatoes, and left the little boy to tend the oven. But he</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">started to day dream, and didn’t watch it all of the time. <font face="Verdana" color="red"><sup>All</sup></font></font></br>
<font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" color="red"><sup>of a sudden he heard a noise, and he looked up and the oven</sup></font></br>
<font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" color="red"><sup>door popped open, and out of the oven jumped a</sup></font></br>
<font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" color="red"><sup>gingerbread man, and went rolling along end over end</sup></font></br>
<font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" color="red"><sup>towards the open door of the house. The little boy ran to</sup></font></br>
<font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" color="red"><sup>shut the door, but the gingerbread man was too quick for</sup></font></br>
<font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" color="red"><sup>him and rolled through the door, down the steps, and out</sup></font></br>
<font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" color="red"><sup>into the road long before the little boy could catch him.</sup></font></br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" color="blue"><sub>The little boy ran after him as fast as he could manage,</sub></font></br>
<font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" color="blue"><sub>crying out to his grandfather and grandmother, who heard</sub></font></br>
<font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" color="blue"><sub>the noise, and threw down their spades in the garden to give</sub></font></br>
<font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" color="blue"><sub>chase too. The gingerbread man outran all three a long way,</sub></font></br>
<font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" color="blue"><sub>and was soon out of sight, while they had to sit down, all out</sub></font></br>
<font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" color="blue"><sub>of breath, on a bank to rest.</sub></font></br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana">On went the gingerbread man, and by-and-by he came to</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">two men digging a well who looked up from their work and</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">called out, "Where ye going, gingerbread man?"</font></br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana">He said, "I’ve outrun an old man, an old woman, and a little</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">boy - and I can outrun you too-o-o!"</font></br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana">"You can, can you? We’ll see about that?" Said they, and so</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">they threw down their picks and ran after him, but couldn’t</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">catch up with him, and soon they had to sit down by the</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">roadside to rest.</font></br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana">On ran the gingerbread man, and by-and-by he came to two</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">men digging a ditch. "Where ye going, gingerbread man?"</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">said they.</font></br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana">He said, "I’ve outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy,</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">and two well diggers, and I can outrun you too-o-o!"</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">"You can, can you? We’ll see about that!" said they, and they</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">too threw down their spades, and ran after him. The</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">gingerbread man soon outstripped them also, and seeing</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">they could never catch him, gave up the chase and sat down</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">to rest.</font></br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana">On went the gingerbread man, and by-and-by he came to a</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">bear. The bear said, "Where are ye going, gingerbread man?"</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">He said, "I’ve outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy,</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">two well diggers, and two ditch diggers, and I can outrun</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">you too-o-o!"</font></br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana">"You can, can you?" Growled the bear. "We’ll see about that!"</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">He trotted as fast as his legs could carry him after the</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">gingerbread man, who never stopped to look behind him.</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">Before long the bear was left so far behind that he saw he</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">might as well given up the hunt at the start, so he stretched</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">himself out by the roadside to rest.</font></br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana">On went the gingerbread man and by-and-by he came to a</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">wolf. The wolf said, "Where ye going, gingerbread man?"</font></br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana">He said, "I’ve outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy,</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">two well diggers, two ditch diggers, and a bear, and I can</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">outrun you too-o-o!"</font></br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana">"You can, can you?" Snarled the wolf. "We’ll see about that!" So</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">he set into a gallop after the gingerbread man, who went on</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">and on so fast, that the wolf too saw there was no hope of</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">overtaking him, and he too lay down to rest.</font></br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana">On went the gingerbread man, and by-and-by he came to a</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">fox that lay quietly in a corner of the fence. The fox called</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">out in a sharp voice, but without getting up, "Where ye</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">going, gingerbread man?"</font></br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana">He said: "I’ve outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy,</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">two well diggers, two ditch diggers, a bear, and a wolf, and I</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">can outrun you too-o-o!"</font></br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana">The fox said, "I can’t quite hear you, gingerbread man. Won’t</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">you come a little closer?" Turning his head a little to one</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">side.</font></br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana">The gingerbread man stopped his race for the first time, and</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">went a little closer, and called out in a very loud voice, "I’ve</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy, two well</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">diggers, two ditch diggers, a bear and a wolf, and I can</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">outrun you too-o-o."</font></br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana">"I still can’t quite hear you. Won’t you come a little closer?"</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">Said the fox in a feeble voice, as he stretched out his neck</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">towards the gingerbread man, and put one paw behind his</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">ear.</font></br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana">The gingerbread man came up close, and leaning towards</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">the fox, screamed out "I’VE OUTRUN AN OLD MAN, AN OLD</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">WOMAN, A LITTLE BOY, TWO WELL DIGGERS, TWO DITCH</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">DIGGERS, A BEAR AND A WOLF, AND I CAN OUTRUN YOU</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">TOO-O-O!"</font></br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana">"You can, can you?" Yelped the fox, and he snapped up the</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">gingerbread man in his sharp teeth in the twinkling of an</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">eye.</font></br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana">And that was the storynory of the gingerbread man. I think</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">that the ending is rather sad, but Bertie doesn’t agree. He</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">says that gingerbread is extremely tasty, and he doesn't</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">blame that fox at all for wanting to eat it. I suppose he has a</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">point, but then again, it’s not just any old piece of</font></br>
<font face="Verdana">gingerbread that can run.</font></br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana" color="yellow"><em>The gingerbread man story's moral is slightly dark for a</em></font>
<font face="Verdana" color="yellow"><em>fable meant for children: Be careful who you trust. The cookie believed the fox when he said</em></font>
<font face="Verdana" color="yellow"><em>he wasn't tempted to eat him—this misguided trust led to the protagonist's downfall.</em></font>
